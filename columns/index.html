                    <h1>For those who came before, those yet to come</h1>
                    <div class="author">James Barragan</div>
                    <p>I wrote the personal essay to my college applications about the Wu-Tang Clan&rsquo;s song &ldquo;C.R.E.A.M.&rdquo; <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s a song about growing up in rough neighborhoods, dealing with gang violence and drugs and thinking that money is the only way out. <br /> <br />That song summed up the way many of the kids in my high school seemed to think. But I wanted something different. I wanted to get an education and change the world. <br /> <br />&ldquo;I want to be a writer so I can come back to kids like me and tell them that there&rsquo;s another way,&rdquo; I wrote. <br /> <br />In my application to the Daily Bruin, I mirrored that thought. <br /> <br />&ldquo;I want to tell the stories about people like me,&rdquo; I remember saying in my nerve-wracking interview for an intern position on the paper. <br /> <br />I&rsquo;ve worked at The Bruin for four years now, and I don&rsquo;t think I can comfortably say that I have told those stories. <br /> <br />I can point to places here and there where this paper, which I had the pleasure of running for an entire year, has told those stories, but there are not many and that makes me feel like I&rsquo;ve failed a little. <br /> <br />So I wanted to take the last thing I&rsquo;ll ever write for this paper and dedicate it to the people who are like me and made me the person I am today &ndash; the wonderful people of the city of Pomona, Calif. <br /> <br />This is for the kids trying to go to college even though their teachers tell them they&rsquo;re not good enough. <br /> <br />This is for second-grade teachers telling a kid from a minority background that his dream to be the president of the United States is completely plausible because this is the United States. <br /> <br />This is for Barack Obama, for proving that true. <br /> <br />This is for my brothers in community college because they didn&rsquo;t have money to afford to go directly to a four-year university. <br /> <br />This is for my sisters who couldn&rsquo;t go to college to pursue their dreams because their patriarchal society told them that a woman&rsquo;s place is at home taking care of the family. <br /> <br />This is for those who made it to college &ndash; that ivory tower where they were promised they would encounter enlightened people &ndash; but only encountered the same discrimination they experienced back home. <br /> <br />This is for the DREAMers who have to sit around doing nothing with their college diplomas because they are missing one little piece of paper that our society says gives them right to be here. <br /> <br />This is for my friends who are too afraid to come out because their parents won&rsquo;t accept the person they love. <br /> <br />This is for the mothers and fathers working two or three jobs to make ends meet, and not being able to see their kids because otherwise there would be no food on the table. <br /> <br />This is for the kids who feel neglected because their parents are not around. <br /> <br />This is for the older brothers and sisters stepping up to take care of their younger siblings because their parents are not there. <br /> <br />This is for our brothers and sisters fighting in the military to keep this country safe. <br /> <br />This is for anybody who&rsquo;s ever been locked up &ndash; it&rsquo;s never too late to change. <br /> <br />I haven&rsquo;t written about these people nearly enough, and that&rsquo;s one of my biggest regrets. <br /> <br />But I accomplished at least one of the goals I set out in my intern application when I was a wide-eyed freshman &ndash; I&rsquo;m a writer and that is a step in the right direction. <br /> <br />I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll end up working after I finish my internship at the Austin American-Statesman this summer, but wherever I go I&rsquo;ll take the stories of these folks with me. <br /> <br />And maybe this is just the beginning. Hopefully, I am just a voice shouting in the wilderness to prepare the way for much better storytellers who come where I come from. <br /> <br />If that turns out to be the case, I&rsquo;ll have to thank all the wonderful and understanding people I met and worked with here at The Bruin for helping me get the ball rolling. <br /> <br />I can&rsquo;t imagine what life would have been like at UCLA these four years if I had not worked here. <br /> <br />This is for the Daily Bruin, thank you. <br /><div class="bio">Barragan was editor-in-chief from 2012-2013, assistant news editor from 2011-2012 and a news and video reporter from 2010-2011.</div> <br /> </p>

                    <h1>Seek to see the extraordinary in the ordinary</h1>
                    <div class="author">Andra Lim</div>
                    <p>I was voted the Daily Bruin&rsquo;s most anal retentive staffer at the end of this year. I would be a bit offended, if the title didn&rsquo;t so obviously suit me. <br /> <br />Part of my job is worrying about small things like headline space, whether to say &ldquo;more&rdquo; or &ldquo;over,&rdquo; where a certain paragraph should be placed and what a tweet should say. Language is slippery, and sometimes a few words or a few sentences make the difference between getting a story right and getting it wrong. <br /> <br />A common criticism of my job &ndash; and others at the paper &ndash; is that it&rsquo;s easy to get bogged down in these details during the grind of putting out a paper Monday through Friday. The big picture can slip out of sight. <br /> <br />At the end of fall quarter, I took a step back and noticed a gap in the paper that I had missed for months. Simply put, our stories lacked soul. We wrote about politics, academics and campus events, but we rarely wrote articles focused solely on people who lived quietly, yet with compassion, bravery and goodness. <br /> <br />Ironically, in obsessing over minutiae, I had forgotten about the beauty of small things, of small acts of human kindness. <br /> <br />Looking back, the stories I&rsquo;ve written that stick out the most are those about people who are, in one sense, totally ordinary &ndash; their names don&rsquo;t spark immediate recognition, and they haven&rsquo;t cured cancer or led a major sports team to victory. But in another sense, they are totally extraordinary. <br /> <br />I spoke with a Japanese literature professor, dying of a rare melanoma, who was determined to continue teaching an undergraduate class in the last weeks of his life. I interviewed another professor who had worked as a plumber to support his family, before quitting his job and pursuing his dream of teaching political science. I wrote about a UCLA staffer who runs a computing program geared toward disabled students, while coping with the challenges his own blindness presents. <br /> <br />During our conversations, these people talked of principles that I&rsquo;ve come to learn, one way or another, these past four years. <br /> <br />Find what you love and do it. It is OK to stumble, again and again. Listen to others, and speak honestly and openly to them in return. Give back. Embrace uncertainty. Spend time with those you love, whether you have a few weeks left or many years. <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s tough to describe what my time at the Daily Bruin has meant to me in a way that doesn&rsquo;t gloss over the many, many moments of frustration and joy that occur day to day. All I can say is: From staring at stories for hours on end, to taking naps on the A&amp;E chair, to eating pizza after finishing the paper on election night, I savored the small stuff. <br /> <div class="bio">Lim was managing editor from 2012-2013, assistant opinion editor from 2011-2012 and a news reporter from 2009-2011.</div></p>

                    <h1>The story is in, it is yours to tell</h1>
                    <div class="author">Devin Kelly</div>
                    <p>I&rsquo;m staring at a white board in the Kerckhoff Hall conference room where I&rsquo;ve spent countless hours in Daily Bruin budget meetings. <br /> <br />Inside a sketch of a page, someone has written four words in brown dry erase marker. <br /> <br />&ldquo;This is your story.&rdquo; <br /> <br />It is, isn&rsquo;t it? <br /> <br />At the Daily Bruin, we wrangle stories like unbroken horses, piecing together quotes and facts and perspectives. <br /> <br />I&rsquo;ve written them, assigned them, edited them, produced them online. <br /> <br />They are the ones that really stick with you. <br /> <br />Of basketball players in Cameroon. <br /> <br />Of a schoolteacher in Japan when the tsunami hit. <br /> <br />Of a terminally ill professor determined to continue teaching. <br /> <br />Of an adventurous math student fighting with Libyan rebels. <br /> <br />We tell the small stories, of a keyboard transported on a skateboard to a residence hall lounge from an attic in Schoenberg Hall. <br /> <br />We tell the large ones, of multimillion dollar budget cuts to a university system trying to figure out how to slow the pace of tuition hikes. <br /> <br />We seek out the humanity in studies, reports, numbers. <br /> <br />These stories are yours. They&rsquo;re not for me, or about me. They&rsquo;re for you. <br /> <br />I&rsquo;m a journalist but I&rsquo;m first and foremost a storyteller. I knew it at age 7, with absolute clarity, winning first prize in a young author&rsquo;s competition in Sacramento, Calif. <br /> <br />I pivoted into journalism at age 17, falling into the rhythm and pace of local news reporting, the profession already running in the veins of my family. <br /> <br />That&rsquo;s my story &ndash; here at UCLA, it&rsquo;s a desk at the Daily Bruin, it&rsquo;s the hunt for the perfect hamburger, it&rsquo;s that one hike in the Pacific Palisades that takes your breath away. <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s 8-clapping at the football game until your hands hurt. <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s the quote from a professor you&rsquo;ll never forget, about how you want to change the world, but it&rsquo;s the world that changes you. <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s friends who tell you what you need to hear. <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s having a dream, and waking up one day to realize it&rsquo;s coming true. <br /> <br />But I&rsquo;m the journalist, and this is your story. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. <br /> <br />Tell it with all your heart. <br /> <div class="bio">Kelly was online managing editor from 2012-2013, news editor from 2011-2012, assistant news editor in 2011 and a news contributor from 2010-2011.</div></p>

                    <h1>Grateful for, humbled by place</h1>
                    <div class="author">Carly Cody</div>
                    <p>Damn, we are some lucky people. <br /> <br />There was a brief moment this quarter when I was walking from the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden toward Kerckhoff Hall and everything got quiet and the sunlight was slanted a particular way and the breeze and, I don&rsquo;t know, but the combination of everything seemed perfect. I experienced something I can only describe as &ldquo;the feels.&rdquo; <br /> <br />I think this moment was somehow poignant because lately I&rsquo;ve felt a senior-year cynicism seeping into my attitude, preventing me from realizing how incredibly in love I am with this place. <br /> <br />This is where the Daily Bruin usually comes in to remind me. I&rsquo;m completely smitten with the idea that the physical paper is a mirror of the physical campus on any given day. <br /> <br />That a group of students converge in an intimate space to create a package that narrates the story of a small community on a daily basis, and the fact that this tangible package is only available on campus seems worth protecting as a particularly special way of preserving a place. <br /> <br />I think the staffers at the Daily Bruin understand this sense of place. <br /> <br />The walls of Kerckhoff 118 partition the office into honeycomb-like pockets of workspace, dividing each section of the newspaper &ndash; from the copy editors to the opinion columnists &ndash; into nooks of productivity. <br /> <br />Stacks of discarded reporters&rsquo; notebooks create piles in the crannies of desks and scribbled-on pieces of paper litter the shelves in every corner. The surfaces of the walls are plastered with &ldquo;wall quotes&rdquo; &ndash; typed transcriptions recording humorous tidbits of overheard conversations between staffers. <br /> <br />Even the ceiling supports a collection of front pages pinned up as a canopy above the heights of outdated computers and camera equipment. <br /> <br />This windowless office represents a place constructed through the paper trail of our storytelling. <br /> <br />More importantly, it has provided me with a place to make connections with some very special people. <br /> <br />Ramsey and Loic, I think I&rsquo;m going to coin the term &ldquo;collegiate soulmates&rdquo; to describe you punks. I hope to be brewing beer and &ldquo;Wagon Wheel&rdquo;-ing with you for a long time to come. <br /> <br />Emma, thank you for redefining the English language with me (i.e. &ldquo;tro&rdquo;) and Liz, your scream-laugh is undeniably infectious, so thank you. <br /> <br />Alexa and Erika, I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to work with anyone else this year. Thank you for making prime magazine everything I wanted it to be. <br /> <br />This last column is only a shy gesture of what my experience working for the paper has meant to me. If nothing more, the Daily Bruin has taught me that you just have to keep making things and treating people well. <br /> <br />This paper and this university have humbled me and for that I&rsquo;m grateful. <br /> <div class="bio">Cody was prime magazine director from 2012-2013, assistant opinion editor from 2011-2012 and a columnist from 2010-2011.</div></p>

                    <h1>Smahl office has big impact</h1>
                    <div class="author">Alexa Smahl</div>
                    <p>Every dank, windowless office can use a little laughter to lighten the mood, and there are few things I enjoy more than making people laugh. Being part of the Daily Bruin helped me realize that. <br /> <br />As the managing editor last year, I aimed to facilitate an environment of creative freedom. I strived to help maintain the paper&rsquo;s history of integrity and excellence. But above all, I wanted to ensure that the office was a place where people truly wanted to be. <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s very easy to get lost in the bustle of the workday. <br /> <br />But when spending seven- to nine-hour intervals in an isolated, wall-facing cubicle, sorting through angry emails about faulty crossword solutions and telling disheartened staffers that their articles aren&rsquo;t printable, you realize the importance of finding the humor in things. <br /> <br />I tried to lighten the mood whenever I could, starting spontaneous Styrofoam snowball fights, mandating Nutella club initiations, providing sardonic commentary at our daily content meetings and contributing many infamous quips to our wall of Post-it quotes. <br /> <br />And when people smiled, I smiled too. <br /> <br />I found the greatest happiness in that of my fellow staffers, relishing their achievements &ndash; both their awards and their growth as journalists and people. <br /> <br />Before ever stepping foot on the UCLA campus, 18-year-old, newly admitted me was already set on joining the Daily Bruin and continuing my pursuit of photography. <br /> <br />Back then, I had no idea what joining the Daily Bruin would mean for me. <br /> <br />During my time as a Bruin, there was only one week that I wasn&rsquo;t a part of the Daily Bruin staff &ndash; that&rsquo;s how deeply ingrained my Daily Bruin experience has been in my college career. <br /> <br />The experience has been one of the greatest and most challenging experiences of my life. <br /> <br />I&rsquo;ll never forget the excitement of my first photo in print, the primal shriek I let out at the Sheraton hotel in Chicago when prime magazine won its first Pacemaker award, the paralyzing fear as I watched Reeves Nelson chuck a basketball toward me through my viewfinder or the rush of racing down the Rose Bowl sidelines with my camera body and 300mm lens slung over my back. <br /> <br />Thank you to the editors that pushed and believed in me. Thank you to my photo mentees who made me more proud than I could have ever imagined. And thank you to a staff that put up with my yearlong, sub-par stand-up comedy routine. <br /> <br />Our adventures in the mysteriously-stained Kerckhoff 118 are memories I&rsquo;ll never forget. <br /> <div class="bio">Smahl was prime magazine photo editor from 2012-2013, managing editor from 2011-2012, assistant photo editor from 2010-2011 and a photo contributor from 2009-2010.</div></p>
